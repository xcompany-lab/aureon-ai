## Milestone History

| Milestone | Status | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 Pipeline Foundation | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-27 |
| v1.1 Autonomous Mode | ⏸️ Paused (Phase 6 deferred) | - |
| v1.2 Layer Audit | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-27 |
| v1.3 NPM Packaging | 🚧 Roadmap ready | - |

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** Pipeline 100% funcional with publish-ready npm package
**Current focus:** v1.3 NPM Packaging — Phase 12 Validation and Docs

## Phase Plan

| Phase | Goal | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 10. Audit Resolution | 0 REVIEW items, DELETEs cleaned | AUDIT-01..04 | Complete |
| 11. Package Sync | Auto-synced files field and .npmignore | SYNC-01..03 | Complete (verified) |
| 12. Validation and Docs | Publish-ready gate + README | VAL-01..03, DOC-01 | Not started |

## Accumulated Context

- Layer audit classified 20,797 items (L1/L2/L3/NEVER/DELETE/REVIEW)
- Phase 10 resolved all REVIEW and DELETE items (0 remaining)
- sync_package_files.py created: derives files field from L1 audit classifications
- package.json `files` field updated: 80 hand-curated -> 143 audit-derived entries
- npm pack --dry-run: 619 files, all L1 (0 violations)
- `.npmignore` regenerated from audit (139 lines, was 232 hand-curated)
- `pre-publish-gate.js` scans for secrets before publish — Phase 12 builds on this

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Phase 10 before Phase 11 | Sync script needs clean audit (0 REVIEW) to produce correct output |
| Phase 11 before Phase 12 | Validation cannot verify correct contents until files field is synced |
| 3 phases (not 2) | Audit resolution is distinct work from packaging — separate concerns |

## Next Action

Phase 11 verified and closed. Proceed to Phase 12: Validation and Docs.
